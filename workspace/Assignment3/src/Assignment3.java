//  Description: THis assignment contains five examples of people breaking the principles of software engineering
/*
 * 
 *  For my examples I chose to provide examples of people breaking the Principles:
 * 1. Public ex: Sam decides to build an application
 * that looks like the Wells Fargo application so that he 
 * can gather user info and take their money. Sam is not acting
 * in the best interest of the public.
 * 2. Christine inbeds certain bugs in her code so that she can steal
 * information from her customer so that she can see what kind of business
 * deals they are doing and she can trade their stock based on her inside information.
 * she is not acting in the best interest of her client or employer
 * 3.Jeff is asked by his employer to only do the minimal amount of work
 * on the project that they are to deliver to their customer so that they
 * can charge the customer more on maintenance charges and software updates in 
 * the future. Jeff is not delivering honest good software.
 * 5. Bob, who manages a group of software engineers for his company encourages
 * them to steal code from other developers and claim it as their own if it will 
 * speed up their own development. He even pays them a bonus to do this.
 * Bob is propagating dishonesty and development through un ethical channels.
 * 7. Ahmed is a team lead and when reporting and presenting his teams software
 * claims full credit while demeaning his fellow colleagues so that he can get a raise
 * and a promotion. He is not being fair and supportive of his colleagues.
